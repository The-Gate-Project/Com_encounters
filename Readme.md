Encounters for Baldur's Gate II : Throne of Bhaal (ToB), Baldur's Gate: EE, Baldur's Gate II: EE, Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT) and the Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET).


## Description:
------------

CoM Encounters is a WeiDU-based mod for Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn and Throne of Bhaal. It adds new encounters, improves the druid grove, makes the Shagbag encounter slightly.   


- A. Improved Druids  

The druids in the Druid Grove had mistakes and were lacking in some areas. Some of them had no druid scripts or druid spells even though they are druids. This has been fixed. Some of them had no weapons or armor which now has been fixed.  

- B. Underdark Adventures   

Here you will meet a drow party who is escorting a matron mother to Ust Natha. Things will not go well and a fight will break out. Later, on the surface, the party will meet the matron's daughter who is not very happy to see you. Also there are additional drow found in Ust Natha.  

- C. Improved Shagbag  

Nothing outragous added, just beefed up the Shagbag encounter and added some new weapons and items.  

- D. Sewer Encounters  

There are two new encounters in the sewers of Amn. They are nothing but thieves and cutthroats or are they?  

- E. Windspear Ecounter  

"He" of great red dragons, has sent a greeting party too meet you and your friends. They are more than thrilled to greet you. Trust me. ;)  

- F. New Stores  

There are three new stores included in this mod. They sell things from junk, scrolls, weapons and armor.  

- G. Ring Quest  

There is a quest in Umar Hills that involves a halfling and his missing ring.
