  <ol>

      instructions in the new DOS window.
  </ol>
  
  <p>Though this mod is made using the WeiDU standard, and *should* be
  compatible with all other WeiDU-based mods, there is always the possibility
  for conflicts.&nbsp; We suggest you install this mod AFTER the official
  patches, Baldurdash, and TeamBG mods.&nbsp;
  If you encounter any problems installing the mod, please our forums.

  <p></a><a HREF="#top">Back to top</a>
  <p><a NAME="compat"><b>III. COMPATIBILITY</b>
  <p>CoM Encounters should be compatible with as many Weidu mods as possible, there is always a chance that incompatibilities will
  arise. 
  <p></a><a HREF="#top">Back to top</a>
  <p><a NAME="faqs"><b>IV. FAQS</b>
  <p>Q: What do I need to use this MOD?<br>
  A: CoM Encounters will require Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn and Throne of Bhall with the latest Bioware/Interplay patches. We also strongly encourage the installation
  of the Baldurdash Fixpack as well. 
  <p>Q: What new encounters are encountered?<br>
  A: There are two new encounters in the sewers. Another is found at Windspear Hills and there is a special Underdark encounter. 
  <p>Q: Will this MOD add new quests or encounters to the Throne of Bhaal expansion?<br>
  A: No there are no new quests or encounters yet. There may be in a future release.
  <p>Q: Why did you decide to develop this MOD?<br>
  A: This mod originally started a long time ago shortly after BG2 came out. It was known as Underdark Adventurers which dealt with adding new encounters in the Underdark and adding additional drow through out those areas. Underdark Adventures originally had new areas added to the Underdark but that was lost due to computer problems. I may redo those areas and put them in a future release. For now what was salvage is included in this mod.

  <b>V. <a NAME="general">GENERAL OVERVIEW</a></b><a NAME="general">
  <p>CoM Encounters(&quot;CE or Encounters&quot;) is a WeiDU-based mod for Baldur's Gate
  II: Shadows of Amn and Throne of Bhaal.&nbsp; It adds new encounters, improves the druid grove, makes the Shagbag encounter slightly harder! As usual, Encounters should be compatible
  with most other WeiDu-based mods, and should be installed after all official
  patches and preferably the Baldurdash Fixpack.&nbsp; Encounters requires the Throne of Bhaal expansion pack.</a>
  <p>Listed below is an explanation of some of the mod's additions:
  <p>&nbsp;
  <blockquote>
  
  <p><b>A. <a NAME="druids">Improved Druids</b>
  <p>The druids in the Druid Grove had mistakes and were lacking in some areas. Some of them had no druid scripts or druid spells even though they are druids. This has been fixed. Some of them had no weapons or armor which now has been fixed.</a>
  <p><b>B. <a NAME="drow">Underdark Adventures</b>
  <p>Here you will meet a drow party who is escorting a matron mother to Ust Natha. Things will not go well and a fight will break out. Later, on the surface, the party will meet the matron's daughter who is not very happy to see you. Also there are additional drow found in Ust Natha.</a>
  <p><b>C. <a NAME="shag">Improved Shagbag</b>
  <p>Nothing outragous added, just beefed up the Shagbag encounter and added some new weapons and items.</a>
  <p><b>D. <a NAME="sewer">Sewer Encounters</b>
  <p>There are two new encounters in the sewers of Amn. They are nothing but thieves and cutthroats or are they?</a>
  <p><b>E. <a NAME="chang">Windspear Ecounter</b>
  <p>"He" of great red dragons, has sent a greeting party too meet you and your friends. They are more than thrilled to greet you. Trust me. ;)</a>
  <p><b>F. <a NAME="stores">New Stores</b>
  <p>There are three new stores included in this mod. They sell things from junk, scrolls, weapons and armor.</a>
  
<p><b>G. <a NAME="ring">Ring Quest</b>
  <p>There is a quest in Umar Hills that involves a halfling and his missing ring.</a>
